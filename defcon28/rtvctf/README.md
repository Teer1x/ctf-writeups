# Red Team Village CTF Qualifier Writeups

Writeups of my solutions to the Red Team Village CTF qualifier on August 6-7, 2020 for DEFCON 28. Thank you to the RTV for creating this CTF, it was a blast!

Note: Due to the huge amount of challenges and only doing this solo, I did not do writeups on several of the categories, such as:

- Tunneler (Unique challenges but hard to write a solid writeup on pivoting)

- Trainer (Kind of like OTW Bandit, nice intro but too many challenges to write on)

- Crypto, Ciphers, and Encodings (Many were find cipher decoder website -> get flag)
